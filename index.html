            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>I am a full-stack developer and The Cup-Cake Factory is a project built as a part of my portfolio. The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The webpage is divided into 5 pages starting with the homepage that runs an automatic carousel and navbar to navigate to other pages. The navbar links to shop Cakes, shop Cupcakes, shop Treats, customize basket and each page is designed uniquely.
                Shop Cakes page is a grid display of cake images and shop Cupcakes provide an interactive UI to dynamically display the quantity and type of cupcake selected. Shop treats display images of cookies, brownies, pies, baskets in a grid layout and can be sorted as per the selected category. Customize basket is an interactive page that helps you to customize a basket by selecting an occasion, choice of basket size, and add treats on the basis of user requirements. The webpage is built to showcase my skills as a full stack developer and enhance my learnings.</p>
